# Mouse Mountain 2, Design Brief v0
## February 21, 2023

### Introduction

Twenty years later, this unity project is, like its predecessor, a skill building exercise. And most likely, it will meet the same fate as Flash given the emerging ML world but, there's still benefits to the thought process of putting something like this together. I would love for this game to be extremely deep in terms of character generation and character relationships. Some influences include: Rim World, Fallout Shelter, Darkest Dungeon, Gloomhaven, and of course, Dwarf Fortress and Creatures.

### Core Concepts

#### The Mountain
We start at the top of the mountain. Our home playing field is a circular hex tile set. As we continue playing we can unlock deeper, larger playing fields to build more and house more characters.

#### Mice
Mice evolve. They gain consciousness/sentience through dreaming and then can convert some skills into genetic traits that can be passed down.

#### The Owl Arch
At the top of the mountain an Owl Ship has crashed, its capabilities are limited at first as it must be repaired. It generates dream waves that turn the small rodents from simple creatures to sentient beings. The game ends when the ship is completely repaired and flies away with a cargo of four mice.

#### Cards
Evolution through dreams and genes is tracked by cards. Cards are applied to mice and have ranges of outcomes.

#### Crafting
Crafting is a form of evolution as well but its range of outcome is applied to the crafted item. A mouse can dream or inherit how to build a shield but the building will determine the shield's attributes.

#### Combat
Just as with the original, the mice have competition. The forest also has a dream machine waking various animals (including other mice) and making them intelligent and violent. The mountain protects our player characters.

#### Base Building
To evolve mice need to build structures that they can be assigned to in typical RTS fashion. Hex space and knowledge limits what one can build.

#### Game Life Cycle
It would be great if the player didn't feel the need to restart the game, even after a devastating event.

#### Encounters
Encounters take place outside the mountain on missions and when the mountain is raided. It is turn based combat also on a hex board.
